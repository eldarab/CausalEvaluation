# Notes To Self

## TODO

### 28.06.2021
* Good enough causal graph.
* Major sections of the writing, Overleaf project.
* Saved models that give results.
* Create a spreadsheet with predictions.
* Add label date to annotations


### 29.06.2021 Meeting with Amir
* Create an agressive version of confounding.
* Label the full the version of the concept linguistic acceptability.
* Implement INLP baseline.
* Read [continuation of INLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.06965), existence of concept instead of counterfactual
* Ask Roi what he thinks about להאדיר INLP


1. Data Collection
2. Run CausaLM
3. Baselines (INLP)
4. Writing


* Draw an outline of the paper. Will deduce the experimental setup and data collection. 2 versions on 2 concepts.
* Subsection: optimizing adversarial methods for causal estimation.
* A lot of data creation and data curation.
* Expand concept 


#### Action items:
0. Schedule week-level
1. eCommerce Lecture 
2. Parse new Amitava data
3. Run experiments of acceptability with new data from Amitava
4. Create an experimental setup - tons of causal graphs and concepts.
5. Map holes in project:
    * Develop code according to the setup chosen (token level classification).
    * Implement INLP.
    * Collect more data for concepts
6. Run all experiments with new data and code pipeline: baselines & token level.
7. Choose among these experiments the best ones.
8. Start writing 18.07.2021


## Code assignments
* Token-level classification.
* INLP Baseline.
* Make sure metrics are correct.
* Aggressive-correlation experiments.
* Full experimental pipeline:
   * Did we forget the TC?
   * Did we remember the CC?
   * ATE_gt
   * INLP_ATE
   * CONEXP
   * TReATE
   * BERT-O


## random

* What does that mean to compute ate on CC?
* Multiple control concepts?
